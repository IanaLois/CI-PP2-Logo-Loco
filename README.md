Welcome to Logo Loco, the ultimate logo quiz game!

Challenge your logo knowledge and recognition skills in the most engaging and visually stimulating way. In a world brimming with countless logos that surround us every day, Logo Loco was designed with a dual purpose: to enhance awareness of iconic brands and to offer a fun and nostalgic gaming experience.

The color scheme for the project was obtained from [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/). This palette was chosen because it has a cool and retro aesthetic that encourages a fun gaming experience while also evoking nostalgia, as if users were playing an old favorite childhood game.

### Fonts

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to generate the font family "REM" and in the event that it doesn't load, it will default to "sans-serif". REM was used throughout the project and was chosen because of its clarity and polished appearance. As the project's name implies, it's a "Logo Loco" multiple choice quiz game with a lot of colours to look at and answers to choose from, so I didn't want to overcomplicate the font style and overwhelm the users.
